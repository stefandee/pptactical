      The latest engine version is <b>0.9.0 RC1</b>.<br>
      <br>
      </font><b><font size="2"> Version Info</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      This version was developed between mid-october 2002 and january 2003, the 
      effective development time being 12 weeks. Also, several bug were fixed 
      and SDL porting was developed during the summer of 2002 by Mike &#8220;tamlin&#8221; 
      Nordell (which, unfortunately, is not working for the engine anymore).</font> 
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0.9.0 RC1 was supposed 
        to be released at the end of November 2002. However, soon after the dev 
        started, it turned that the engine framework is not able to support vehicles 
        with turrets and the pathfinding algorithm cannot support units larger 
        than 1x1 (cells). </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first problem 
        was solved splitting object classes and moving functionalities to another 
        class hierarchy called &#8220;subsystems&#8221;. This opened the path 
        to objects that may perform simultaneous actions (like firing and moving) 
        &#8211; which is not as simple as it seems :) Both objects and subsystems 
        hierarchies need refactoring (to a certain extent&#8230;) and the refactoring 
        process will probably end with the release 1.0 (or&#8230;never? :)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second problem 
        was not solved and it will be fixed only in 1.0 </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One feature (aircrafts 
        &#8211; fighters/bombers/dropships) was left out. That&#8217;s because 
        of the refactoring issue. They will appear in 0.9.5</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mission scripting 
        was introduced instead and now it is possible to create your own missions. 
        There&#8217;s a lot of control over mission variables provided by this 
        scripting and I hope to see heart-breaking ground-shaking missions from 
        the engine users :)</font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0.9.0 RC1 is pretty 
        stable. Further testing will be performed and bug fixes will be integrated 
        in the next RC&#8217;s.<br>
